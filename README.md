Update! I'm finally going to take the death threats down from my atabook as I don't want anyone being distrubbed by the death threats. I still will have ss of them just in case i need them though! ^_^
Though it is very insteresting to see how BUTT HURT someone can be over somehing so small.(You know who you are.)

look man sending death threats dont really hurt me(if you are the one who sent them an are reading this) but u shouldn't really do such a petty thing on someones PUBLIC PAGE(atabook). ppl may not know who u are but if they find out it'll look a lot worse for u😭🙏

sprry my spelling is garabge on tablet ://
